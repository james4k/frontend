Articles collection. Need to add frontmatter unmarshalling support to
j4k.co/pages, basically. Perhaps provide generic collection support in
the pages package?

pages.Handler API is bad; need to rehink that. Needs to be more
composable with other handlers and shiz. Think about how a caching
handler would deal with it, and whatevers.

New images for about page; too small with new page width and will look
blurry, especially with high DPI. Should keep some high-res versions
around *sigh*

Index needs.. content. Point to about page, briefly summarize past work.
Maybe just show recent tweets and soundcloud activity.. and of course,
my recent articles/blog.

Do we want to distinguish blog and articles? Yes, probably. Articles for
all content designed to be long-lived, and will be organized more
carefully for later discovery, blog for any ramblings or lower-quality
content in general.
