<p>My current favorite toy is the <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> programming language. It is characterized by a great simplicity that you easily come to appreciate.</p>
<p>My current curiosity is in using real-time graphics for extreme skeumorphism. This is about using realistic lighting models and material rendering to create rich, engaging user interfaces.</p>
<p>Below are some of the games and other works I have been involved in.</p>
